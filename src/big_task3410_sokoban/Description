SOKOBAN

Simple version of the famous game - https://sokoban.info/

We are moving the Sokoban using the keyboard arrows and restarting the game by pressing "r".

The user interface is implemented with Swing and the levels are being kept in levels.txt file,
the LevelLoader class is reading them one by one.

Run this app by starting Controller.main() and have fun :)
