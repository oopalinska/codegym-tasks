2048

This is the Java implementation of the game 2048, implemented based on MVC pattern, with the View class (Swing)
copied from CodeGym. A little instruction for playing the game:

1. Run through the Main class.
2. Make your own moves by using the arrows.
3. Undo moves by pressing Z.
4. Make a random move by pressing R.
5. Make an auto move (merging the most tiles and giving the best score) by pressing A.

Enjoy :)
