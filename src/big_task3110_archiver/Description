ARCHIVER

At the moment, this archiver program is able to:
1. Create an archive
2. Add a file to an archive
3. Remove a file from an archive
4. Extract an archive's contents
5. View an archive's contents
6. Exit the program

CREATE
We need to write "0" in the console.
First, provide the correct path to archive, for example:
D:\\archive.rar
If it doesn't exist, it will be created.
Second, provide the correct full path to the file or directory to be zipped.
If the archive existed before, all the files that it included will disappear - only the newly added ones will be available.

ADD
Write "1" in the console.
First, provide the correct path to archive, for example:
D:\\archive.rar
It has to exist, otherwise the command will not work.
Second, provide the correct full path to the file (not directory) to be added.
All the files that the archive included before will be saved, together with the newly added ones.
If the file with the same name existed before, it will not be overridden.

REMOVE
Write "2" in the console.
First, provide the correct path to archive, for example:
D:\\archive.rar
It has to exist, otherwise the command will not work.
Second, provide the correct name (not full path!) of a file to be removed.

EXTRACT
Write "3" in the console.
First, provide the correct path to archive, for example:
D:\\archive.rar
It has to exist, otherwise the command will not work.
Second, provide the correct full path to your target directory.

VIEW
Write "4" in the console.
Provide the correct path to archive, for example:
D:\\archive.rar
Contents will be displayed on the console.

EXIT
Just write "5" in the console.
