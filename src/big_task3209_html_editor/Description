HTML EDITOR

This task was my first serious attempt to create graphical interface with the Swing library.
I managed to complete it thanks to detailed step-by-step instructions from CodeGym and I still find understanding
this code very challenging.
I have decided to save it here anyway in order to analyze it in the future.

Learned the basics of:
- Creating applications with a graphical interface.
- Working with dialog boxes.
- Using classes from the Swing library.
- Implementing interaction between program components with the help of events, listeners, and actions.
- Using the MVC pattern as the architectural framework for applications.

Might improve in the future:
- Add a toolbar that replicates the functionality of the menu.
- Add highlighting of HTML tags on the second tab.
- Add the ability to load a document from the Internet.
- Expand the editor's capabilities (insert images, links, etc.)
