RESTAURANT MANAGER APP (+ ELECTRONIC MENU)

A program to automate some tasks in the restaurant:
1) Each table has a tablet that can be used to place orders.
2) While an order is being prepared, the tablet shows advertisements.
3) At the end of the business day, various statistics can be reviewed:
- cook utilization,
- total revenue from orders,
- total revenue from advertisement impressions.

FUTURE TO-DO:
1. Threads usually use the ThreadLocalRandom class instead of Random.
   Refactor the code: replace Random with ThreadLocalRandom.
2. Make Waiter a task so that it works like a thread (remove Observer). Make a queue of prepared orders.
   Have the waiter take orders from it and carry them out to the tables.
3. Write a NoVideosAvailableEventDataRow event in the event log when it is not possible to select a video.
   Pass this event to the manager.
4. Write a UI, for example, using Swing.

What I've learned by completing this task:
1. Figured out the Observer pattern.
2. Practiced ability to use recursion.
3. Got acquainted with a way to implement statistics.
4. Worked on how to break a task into subtasks.
